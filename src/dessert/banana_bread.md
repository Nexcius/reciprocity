**Difficulty:** Easy

**Time to prepare:** 1 hour

**Serving size:** One bread

This is by far my favourite snack to make and keep around in the cupboard. It's a hit with all ages. As it uses no sugar and only whole wheat flour, it's decently healthy as well. I like to eat this plain, but you can also have it with butter (or brown cheese of you're feeling Norwegian). The result is a soft, moist bread which can be stored for at least some days without becoming dry.


## Ingredients
- ¾ dl olive oil
- 1¼ dl honey
- 2 eggs

- 1 teaspoon baking soda (natron, not baking powder)
