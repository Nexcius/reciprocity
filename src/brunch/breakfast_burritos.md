**Difficulty:** Medium

**Time to prepare:** 30 minutes

**Serving size:** Two portions

Breakfast burritos has quickly become one of my favoirite recipes for brunch. It's easy to make and the recipe is very flexible based on what you have available in your fridge. It's a healthy meal and can easily be packed and brought for later as well. My personal favourite is made with mushrooms and a lot of greens.

Use the tortilla with egg as a base, swap out the ingredients for whatever you have laying around, and sprinkle with cheese to make it your own.


## Ingredients
**Guacamole**
- 1 avocado
- 1 tbsp sourcream
- &half; lime

**Tortillas**
- 2 large tortillas
- 3 medium sized champignons
- &half; onion
- 2 eggs
- 1 tomato
- 50g white cheese or cheddar
- Baby spinach
- Chili flakes


## Method
**Preparations**
1. In a bowl, start by mashing the avocado
1. Add the sourcream and lime to the bowl and mix it in
1. Add some salt, pepper, and chili flakes to taste
1. Whisk the eggs in another bowl and gently salt them
1. Grate the cheese and cut the tomatoes to about 1cm squares
1. Cut the onion to small pieces and the slice the mushrooms

**Mushroms**
1. Fry the onion in some butter on medium-high heat
1. After 3 minutes, add the mushrooms and cook until they turn brown on medium heat
1. Put the mushrooms aside in a bowl for later

**Tortilla**
1. Wipe clean the pan and add some butter
1. Still on medium heat, add a thin layer of the egg mix to the pan
1. Once the egg starts solidifying but are still runny on the top (about 30 seconds), add the tortilla so that the egg fastens to it. It's a good idea to toss the pan around a bit, so the eggs don't stick to the pan. Cook the eggs for another minute.
1. Put a cutting board on top of the pan and turn it upside down so the tortilla falls out

**Wrapping it up**
1. The trick here is to not add too much of the ingredients, so it can be wrapped later
1. Spread some guacamole on top of the egg inside the burrito
1. Add the mushrooms and sprinkle the tomatoes, baby spinach, and cheese on top
1. Fold one of the short sides over, then the long side, the other short side, and finish with the last long side
1. Put the burrito in the pan with the fold down on medium heat for 3 minutes with a lid, or 5 minutes without

**Serving**
1. Cut the burrito in two and plate it
1. Add some sourcream on the side of the plate and top the burrito with some siracha or hot sauce if you like it spicy
